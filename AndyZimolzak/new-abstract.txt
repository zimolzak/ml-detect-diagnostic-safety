# Abstract

Background: Electronic triggers have been used extensively to identify
instances of potential diagnostic error, but largely they identify
patterns suggestive but not definitive. Expert chart review is
ordinarily required to separate e-trigger outputs into true and false
instances of missed opportunities for diagnosis (MOD). E-triggers have
varying degrees of predictive value: sometimes quite low. They are
often crafted from first principles, rather than based on empiric data
patterns. Machine learning (ML) is a promising approach to append to a
rules-based trigger tool, to enhance predictive value for detecting
MODs. Therefore, we sought to create a ML classifier to emulate human
chart reviewers at larger scale, separating e-trigger output into true
and false MODs.

Methods: Based on the input of an expert panel, we designed two
rules-based electronic triggers to find possible MOD, in the emergency
department. Specifically, we examined ER visit with dizziness or
abdominal pain, with high risk features, and discharge to home,
followed by subsequent hospital admission. Trained clinicians reviewed
a random sample of charts for each e-trigger and labeled each as MOD
or no MOD. Labeled charts were used to train L1-regularized logistic
regression. Candidate features were demographics, lab values, vital
signs, medications, and past history based on encounter diagnoses, and
ER diagnostic orders, from index ER encounter and subsequent
encounters.

Results: Chart review showed 00% positive predictive value (PPV) for
the stroke trigger, and 00% PPV for abdominal pain. For stroke, the
best performing ML filter improved PPV to 00%, missing 00% percent of
true cases. For abdominal pain, the best ML improved PPV to 00%,
missing 00% percent of cases. Area under the receiver operating
characteristic curve was 0.00, indicating reasonable discrimination
between MOD and no-MOD cases. If applied at scale, the ML-enhanced
triggers would flag 1234 cases instead of 4321, where 1000/1234 are
true MODs, rather than 1111/4321.

Conclusions: We applied ML as a second stage to electronic trigger
tools for MODs. We found improved predictive value while missing
relatively few cases of true MOD. This technique can be applied to
multiple other rules-based e-triggers for diagnostic error.
Limitations include time-intensive feature engineering, and that
certain features are more pertinent to individual conditions (e.g.,
numeric labs are more pertinent to abdominal pain than to stroke).
Next steps can include incorporation of data from text notes, and
semi-supervised approaches embedding known cases of MOD and finding
highly similar cases.
