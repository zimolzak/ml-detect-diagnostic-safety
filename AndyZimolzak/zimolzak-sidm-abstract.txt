# Abstract

Background: Electronic triggers (e-triggers) are useful to find cases
of diagnostic error in large databases but have several limitations.
Their predictive values are low, and time-consuming manual chart
review is required to separate e-trigger outputs into true and false
instances of missed opportunities for diagnosis (MOD). Because
e-triggers are designed using a-priori assumptions versus empiric data
patterns, they may not detect signals of MOD comprehensively. Machine
learning (ML) could enhance e-trigger predictive value and emulate
human chart reviewers at larger scale. Therefore, we sought to create
e-triggers with enhanced accuracy, where records flagged by a
first-stage traditional e-trigger are further refined by a
second-stage ML classifier into true and false MODs.

Methods: Based on expert panel input, we designed two rules-based
e-triggers to find possible MODs in the emergency department. First,
we found cases of an index ER visit with dizziness or vertigo, in
patients with stroke risk factors, who were discharged from ER to home
but had a subsequent hospital admission for stroke or TIA within 30
days. Second, we found cases of an index ER visit with abdominal pain
in patients with abnormal temperature, who were discharged from ER to
home but had subsequent hospital admission within 30 days. Trained
clinicians reviewed a random sample of charts flagged by the e-trigger
and labeled each as MOD or no MOD. Labeled charts were used for
training and test datasets for ML methods including regularized
logistic regression and random forests. ML had access to demographics,
lab values, vital signs, medications, test orders, and encounter
diagnoses.

Results: For the dizziness e-trigger, 38 records were true positive
MOD, of 82 flagged (46% positive predictive value [PPV]). The
best-performing ML algorithm correctly identified 37 of the 38 true
positives and 43 of 44 true negatives (97% PPV). For the abdominal
pain e-trigger, 31 records were true positive MOD, of 104 flagged (30%
PPV). ML correctly identified 26 of 31 true positives and 71 of 73
true negatives (93% PPV).

Conclusions: We successfully applied machine learning using structured
data to enhance the accuracy of electronic triggers to find missed
opportunities for diagnosis. This approach improved predictive value
and missed few cases of true MODs. Limitations include time needed to
prepare variables used by ML, although once this is done, the
algorithm can run at large scale. Next steps include applying our
two-stage approach to additional rules-based e-triggers to reduce the
future need for manual reviews.
